This is the repository storing the code for the **Browse Task** web page I developed for browsing tasks for the website **Tasker Coming**. **Tasker Coming** was a project I worked on in a team of ten students as part of the [Web Full-stack Development Bootcamp at JR Academy](https://jracademy.com.au/bootcamp/web-code-bootcamp-or-learn-to-code-1/description/). The domain for the [Tasker Coming](https://taskercoming.com) website is now inactive, however the frontend and backend repositories for the code behind the website can still be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TaskComing).

To run the React app, clone the repository into your desktop, then use Visual Studio Code to open the folder. At the root of the folder, run **npm start** in the terminal and a web page will be display in your browser.
